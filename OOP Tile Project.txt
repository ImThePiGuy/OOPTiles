OOP Tile Project

----------------------------------------------------

From Matthew:
    
The two algorithms you’ll be implementing for this project 
is breadth first search and djikstras algorithm. To do this, you’ll
want to create a grid of tiles who have references to their
neighbors. You’ll also want to learn about queues and priority
queues. The first problem for you to solve is: how can I change
the colors of tiles within a certain radius of a given tile? 
The second problem: how can I change the color of the tiles on the 
shortest path between a-b. Both problems require the usage of a 
priority queue and your grid of tiles which contain the information 
for their connections.
